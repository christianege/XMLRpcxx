How to build
============

The XMLRpcxx project uses CMake to build.

Building on Linux
-----------------

For out-of-source build, first we have to create an subdirectory and change to it :

  mkdir linux-build
  cd linux-build/

The next step is to call cmake:

  cmake ../

This creates an standard Makefile for linux if you want a specific project/build file this is provided by the “-G” Flag.

  cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" ../

Build with debug informations
-----------------------------

To enable debug informations you have to specify an build type

  cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../

Cross-Compiling
---------------

  cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../tool-chains/eldk-ppc6xx.cmake ..
